This project is implementation of three Technical Challenges. 

**Prerequisite**

- Java 
- Maven 
- Eclipse 
- TestNG

**RUN**

Below are the ways to run all three files :
1. Technical Challenge 1: Run testng.xml file in GuiTest package, Right Click - Run As - TestNG Suite
2. Technical Challenge 2: Run TechnicalChallenge2.java file in ApiTest package, Right Click - Run As - TestNG Suite 
3. Technical Challenge 3: Run TechnicalChallenge3.java file in CodingProblem package, Right Click - Run As - Java Application

Below is the dicussion about all the three Challenges with their respective link to the corresponding files:

- Technical Challenge 1: This was a GUI test which was parameterized using TestNG to run it in three browsers, firefox, IE and Chrome in parallel. Before execution, path of the respective drivers for each browser need to be updated according to their location in local machine.
